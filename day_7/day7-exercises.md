## Day 7: Create a Site


## User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)

  1. Psychology: How does this make them feel?

  * Good: [Apple](https://www.apple.com)
  * Bad: [Ranker](https://www.ranker.com/list/terrible-life-hacks/mrennie?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=post&pgid=144361577286&utm_campaign=terrible-life-hacks&fbclid=IwAR1KgAqTBhojjwuQULR-zhrARMCHdrRxhNGfhbkNkdNaMHLPDbv_0w-Jiaw)

  While Apple's website is minimalist, the two websites listed actually have similar layouts. The Ranker website is busy and has many ads. The lack of organization of the ads in the Ranker website make me feel nervous.

  2. Usability: Is it easy to find, hard to miss, or subconsciously expected?

  * Good: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com)
  * Bad: [Connect for Health Colorado](https://connectforhealthco.com)

  Amazon's webpage is very easy to understand and navigate because you buy every product in the exact same way. The 'add to cart' button is in the same place for every product. The Connect for Health Colorado website is confusing and has the user enter in personal data in order to see anything.

  3. Design: Does it represent the brand? Does it feel like the same site?

  * Good: [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com)
  * Bad: [Boulder Running Company](https://www.jackrabbit.com/info/boulder-running-company)

  The Starbucks website is minimalist and only has three tabs. It focuses on coffee and that alone. The Boulder Running Company website isn't very clear because you need to go to their parent company's website to look at products. The brand isn't consistently shown and it's confusing.

  4. Copywriting: Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?

  * Good: [The Onion](https://www.theonion.com/)
  * Bad: [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/)

  Although The Onion webpage looks more dated, it contains all the major stories on the top of the webpage right when you load in. The largest picture has the most important story. Buzzfeed doesn't do a good job because the top half of the page is covered in an ad. It might sell more ads, but doesn't really get their stories out there to be easily clickable.

  5. Analysis: Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behavior?

  * Good: [Sony](https://www.sony.com/)
  * Bad: [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/us/)

  This question was the hardest to answer since we don't really know what kind of data the website is using from its users. Sony's website keeps to a minimalist design and is easier to navigate since there are fewer options. There are also large, news-like stories that are easily and quickly interpreted. Samsung doesn't do as good of a job with a scrolling carousel of photos that tell about the disjointed products.
