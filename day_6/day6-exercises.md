# Day 6: JavaScript


## Chapter 3 Questions


1.  If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?

  `sayHello` is the name of the function and its value is the code block of statements in the function.

  `sayHello()` will run the function.


2.  What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
  * Parameters: Act like variables in a function.
  * Arguments: Actual values that you add as inputs to a function.

3.  What is the keyword `return` used for?

  `return` is used to return a value to the code that called the function. Think of it as the output of the function.

4.  How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?

  Local variables are better than global variables for a couple reasons. A local variable is preferable when using a function multiple times. The local variable can change as many times as you need. Global variables take up more memory when using a website and increases the risk for naming conflicts. You might want to use a global variable when referencing something that isn't changed on the website, like a company's physical location.
